# How to use basic git! ðŸ–¥

I made this repository for people who don't know how to use git and might want to start with it and for me when i eventually forget all of this stuff and need it!

Also i'm kinda aware that VSCode has it's own source code with github thingy on the side-bar, but i still think it's important to learn these kind of things 

If i missed something i might update it some day
